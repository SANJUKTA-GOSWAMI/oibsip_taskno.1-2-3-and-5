# Oasis_Internship 

As a Data Science Intern of Oasis Infobyte I have completed these tasks by using python and some algorithms of AI and Machine Learning.
Completing my internship at Oasis Infobyte in Data Science was an extremely positive experience for me. Throughout my time there, I learned a great deal about various tools and techniques used in Data Science, and was able to apply them to real-world problems.

One of the most valuable aspects of my internship was learning about data manipulation and visualization tools such as Pandas and Matplotlib. I was able to gain a deep understanding of how these tools work and how they can be used to analyze and visualize data in meaningful ways.

In addition to this, I was also able to gain valuable experience in the field of Machine Learning. I worked on a project that involved implementing various Machine Learning algorithms on an India employment dataset. This project allowed me to gain a better understanding of how Machine Learning algorithms work and how they can be used to solve complex problems.

Throughout my internship, I received guidance and mentorship from experienced professionals in the field of Data Science. This allowed me to deepen my knowledge and understanding of the field and provided me with valuable insights into how to approach complex data problems.

Overall, completing my internship at Oasis Infobyte in Data Science was an incredibly rewarding experience. I was able to learn a great deal about various data science tools and techniques, as well as gain valuable experience in the field of Machine Learning. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such a talented team and to have gained such valuable experience.
